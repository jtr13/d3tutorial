```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE,
                      error = TRUE)
```

### Before Class

1. If you don't have it already, download the Chrome browser.

### HTML

1. Here is the structure of a  .html document, which consists of a "head" and a "body".  Add a title and various elements to the body, such as headers and paragraphs:

    \<h3>This is an h3 header.\</h3>
    
    \<p>This is a paragraph.\</p>

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
	    <head>
		    <meta charset="utf-8">
		    <title></title>
	    </head>
	    <body>
	    </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. Open it in Chrome on half the screen, and keep RStudio (or whatever text editor you're using) open on the other half of the screen.
