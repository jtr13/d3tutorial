```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE,
                      error = TRUE)
```

### Before Class

1. If you don't have it already, download the Chrome browser.

### HTML

1. Create a text file in RStudio\* (File, New File, Text File)  (\* or whatever text editor you are using) 

1. Here is the structure of a simple .html document, which consists of a "head" and a "body".  Type it in and save the file as "myfile.html"

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
	    <head>
		    <meta charset="utf-8">
		    <title></title>
	    </head>
	    <body>
	    </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Add a title (doesn't appear on the web page itself) to the *head* section and various elements to the *body*, such as headers and paragraphs:

    \<h3>This is an h3 header.\</h3>
    
    \<p>This is a paragraph.\</p>

1. Open it in Chrome on half the screen, and keep RStudio (or whatever text editor you're using) open on the other half of the screen. 

1. Make a change to the .html file, save it and refresh the file in the browser to see it.  (Keyboard shortcuts &#2318s; and &#2318r;)
