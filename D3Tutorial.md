### Before Class

1.  If you don't have it already, download the Chrome browser.

### HTML

1.  Create a text file in RStudio\* (File, New File, Text File) (\* or whatever text editor you are using)

2.  Here is the structure of a simple .html document, which consists of a "head" and a "body". Type it in and save the file as "myfile.html"

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title></title>
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

3.  Add a title (doesn't appear on the web page itself) to the *head* section and various elements to the *body*, such as headers and paragraphs:

    &lt;h3&gt;This is an h3 header.&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

4.  Open it in Chrome on half the screen, and keep RStudio (or whatever text editor you're using) open on the other half of the screen.

5.  Make a change to the .html file, save it and refresh the file in the browser to see it. (Keyboard shortcuts &\#2318s; and &\#2318r;)
