### Before Class

1.  If you don't have it already, download the Chrome browser.

### HTML

1.  Here is the structure of a .html document, which consists of a "head" and a "body". Add a title and various elements to the body, such as headers and paragraphs:

    &lt;h3&gt;This is an h3 header.&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title></title>
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

2.  Save the file.

3.  Open it in Chrome on half the screen, and keep RStudio (or whatever text editor you're using) open on the other half of the screen.
